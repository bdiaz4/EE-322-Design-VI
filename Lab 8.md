# Lab 8 â€” Data Analysis
## Setup
numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas keras were installed.
Tensorflow did not work with python 3.13 so python was reverted to 3.11.
In order to use plt_final.py, the csv file for lab 7 was downloaded and saved to lesson 8. Then plt_final.py was updated to 
data = read_csv('cpudata - Sheet1.csv')
x = data['CPU Usage %']
y = data[' Temperature C (or Memory Available GB for cpudata)']
to match the headers and name of the file exactly.
## Graphs
The following graphs were outputed running `plt_final.py`

# Lab 10 â€” Blockchain
## Hash Introduction
The script `hash_value.py` was ran twice to see which variable types change value.

It was found that integers and decimals do not but variable types such as objects, tuples, and strings do randomly.
## Blockchain Introduction
Next, `snakecoin.py` outputed 20 blocks each with its own randomly assigned hash value. This was done by creating the first block based on the current date and time and recursively creating more blocks, getting the time again, and adding a random value to the hash via a string.
